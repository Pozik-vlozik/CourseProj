<h1>My Planner program project</h1> 

<h3>Second course project</h3>
<p>
    It is designed to create simple BTI plannings
</p>

<p>
    When program starts we will see simple menu
    <p align="center">

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If you choose "Create new planning" scale choose form will appear where your can name your planning and set scale
    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/2_scale_choose.png" alt="">
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If planning with such name already existing, you will be warned
    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/3_same_name.png" alt="">
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Then you could see form, where you can change size of your rooms and place them
    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/4_drawing_form.png" alt="">
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Rooms measurments displays in it. If you want to end planning and not all your rooms are connected, you will see warning
    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/5_placing_rooms.png" alt="">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/6_rooms_not_connected.png" alt="">
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If all your rooms are connected you can continue planning
    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/7_valid_rooms_positions.png" alt="">
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    On the next step you can place furniture in your rooms
    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/8_furniture_placement.png" alt="">
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After all furniture is placed you can save your planning
    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/9_furniture_placed.png" alt="">
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Or go back to previous step and add/delete several rooms
    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/10_adding_extra_room.png" alt="">
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After finishing your planning you will see (according to the furniture you put in rooms) living, non living and general area of your apartment
    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/11_square.png" alt="">
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After saving you will be able to load your planning 
    <p align="center">
        <img src="images/12_loading_saved_planning.png" alt="">
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    When planning is loaded you can change everything you want and save it again
